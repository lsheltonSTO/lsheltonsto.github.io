      <description>I was going through a really rough time. I had experienced a loss that so many do experience – one of my 14 year old littermate kitties, Archie, had taken a sudden turn and had to be put to sleep. It was almost my birthday and I had lost one of my beloved cats and I was feeling very sorry for myself.
However, it was time to pull myself together and pack my bags, because I was headed to the inaugural Power Platform Conference in Orlando, FL all my myself.</description>

      <description>Bing AI Image Creator got a little weird, but let’s go with it. The others were far weirder.
Recently I was asked if I could add a success message to a Power App – something to indicate that they’ve clicked the button. I added a beautiful spinner and dusted off my hands, job well done.
Well, no, they wanted to know that the Power Automate flow that the button triggered had actually run successfully.</description>

      <description>I couldn’t believe this wasn’t a template already when I searched, so I figured – blog post it is! Two in a month, I did it again!
The Use Case This one is pretty simple. A user reached out and said she had a idea for how to use Power Automate, but she wasn’t sure how to make it happen. This immediately spikes my adrenaline, and I start searching triggers and actions right away.</description>

      <description>I didn’t realize how painful this process would be until I embarked upon it, and so, Dear Reader, I’m looking to combine the resources that helped me into one place to help you if you are to find yourself in a similar scenario.
The Use Case I was recently given a scenario where, as an important step in a proposed new process, a OneNote notebook nestled within a private Teams channel would be populated with a new page whenever a flow was triggered.</description>

      <title>Utilizing the Contents of a SharePoint Image Column Elsewhere</title>

      <description>So I recently met with someone who had a conundrum. They had a SharePoint list with an Image type column, relatively new-ish, and they wanted to post the contents of this column to Teams on a regular cadence, along with other text column content. They had tried every dynamic content option related to the Image column in Power Automate and nothing was working. I found quite a few blog posts that got us close, but not all the way.</description>

      <title>Connections in Power Automate (and How to Take Control of Them)</title>
      <link>https:/blog/202302connections-in-power-automate/</link>

      <description>Do you have a flow running, proud as can be, except… the emails it sends out says they are from you? Did you get help on a flow and now it says that the SharePoint library is being updated by your coworker?
All of this is due to ~connections~ in Power Automate. I’m going to attempt to quickly introduce them, go over how to change and then remove them, and explain a best practice with connections.</description>

      <description>At my office, we have a lot of documents that undergo an annual review process. I was tasked pretty early on in my time here to help move this process from an Access database into the cloud. I could go on and on about the intricacies of what we set up, but I wanted to zero in on just one feature of the Power Automate flows that are set up: the group approval.</description>

      <title>Frankenstein’s Monster Error Handling for Power Automate Cloud Flows</title>

      <description>Be warned now – the content in this post is not 100% from my own brain and genius. In fact, it is cobbled together from three different geniuses who were kind enough to post their own methods for error handling in Power Automate over the years. I’ve judiciously bookmarked those posts, just waiting for when I had time and motivation to tackle error handling in my own flows, and today was that day.</description>

      <description>The Problem and Requirements I work at a medical research institute that is incredibly diverse. We have scientists from all over the globe, which can lead to some frustration on everyone’s part when it comes to the diverse names that these employees have. To be clear – it’s not just an issue of names that aren’t “American” causing “problems” – we have so many immigrant employees that even names that may seem straightforward, like “Lindsay”, can be confusing.</description>
