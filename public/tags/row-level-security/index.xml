The Use Case A brief recap - I had 19 separate Power BI reports that, for various reasons, we decided to condense into one mega report using row-level security, or RLS. This gives each lab information about their storage - how much data are they storing, what does it cost, and a list of files that haven&amp;rsquo;t been updated in 3 years that might be prime targets for archiving.</description></item><item><title>Using Row-Level Security in Power BI and Power Automate</title><link>https://blist.vercel.app/blog/20240105using_row_level_security_in_power_bi_and_power_automate/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2024 11:29:05 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://blist.vercel.app/blog/20240105using_row_level_security_in_power_bi_and_power_automate/</guid><description>Power BI is not my normal wheelhouse, but when duty calls, I answer. I was recently asked to help update a report in Power BI that does all sorts of SQL calls to a database - how all of that works is a mystery to me. However, we were managing security by updating 19 different reports, one for each lab. This was a nightmare to maintain and update, as I discovered when my job was to go in and update all 19 of those reports.</description></item></channel></rss>
