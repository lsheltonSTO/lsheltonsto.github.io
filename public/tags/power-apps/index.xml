      <description>I was going through a really rough time. I had experienced a loss that so many do experience – one of my 14 year old littermate kitties, Archie, had taken a sudden turn and had to be put to sleep. It was almost my birthday and I had lost one of my beloved cats and I was feeling very sorry for myself.

      <description>The Problem and Requirements I work at a medical research institute that is incredibly diverse. We have scientists from all over the globe, which can lead to some frustration on everyone’s part when it comes to the diverse names that these employees have. To be clear – it’s not just an issue of names that aren’t “American” causing “problems” – we have so many immigrant employees that even names that may seem straightforward, like “Lindsay”, can be confusing.</description>
