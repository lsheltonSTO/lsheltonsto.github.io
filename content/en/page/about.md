I'm a 30-something in her second career just living the dream.  Currently I work for a medical research institute non-profit, working to support scientists in advancing our mission.

I spent the last decade teaching English Language Arts.  During that time, I was selected to receive training to become a technology and pre-engineering teacher based on my aptitude for learning and adapting new technologies with my own students and colleagues.

I holds a BS in Secondary English Education from the University of Kansas and an MS in Curriculum and Instruction from Emporia State University. In addition, I am certified in Microsoft 365 Teams Administration, Microsoft Power Platform Fundamentals, Microsoft 365 Fundamentals, and I am a Microsoft Certified Trainer.  As of 2023, I am also a Microsoft MVP in Business Applications.

In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my two kittens Charlie and Trixie, and marathoning a wide variety of television shows.  Reach out with questions, comments, or thoughts about the latest Bravo reality shows.

I do this for free because I enjoy doing it, but if I've helped you solve a problem and you feel so inclined, <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/lindsaytshelton">buy me a Diet Coke</a> to keep my habit going and help me keep churning out more blogs!
