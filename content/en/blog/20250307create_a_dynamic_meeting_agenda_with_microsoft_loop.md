Ever wished you could update your meeting agenda or collaborate on the agenda with attendees without sending endless emails? With Microsoft Loop, you can! 

Loop is a Microsoft product that has something called Components.  Loop Components are like little building blocks of content, such as lists or tables, that you can share and update across different Microsoft apps. They stay in sync everywhere, so everyone always has the latest info, no matter where they're working.

So, you can insert a Loop Component into the body of a meeting in Outlook, use it to start building an agenda, and then others can add to it and edit it – all without those annoying calendar notifications.

To get started, simply make a new meeting in Outlook (or edit an existing one) and go to the body of the meeting:

Look for the icon at the bottom of the meeting invite that is a blue… well, loop, and click on it.

You may be surprised the first time you click on this to see all of the Loop Component options available for you to use!

Feel free to play around with the options!  For the purposes of this tip, we are going to add a simple Bulleted list, so select the first option.

From here, you can add a title and start typing in the agenda items that you already know about – or maybe just a prompt for people to add agenda items below – it’s totally up to you!

One thing to note is that this is actually available in classic Outlook – you just have to go to the Insert menu and also don’t have access to quite as many Component options.

Also, in new Outlook, if you are an M365 Copilot license holder, you will see that little Copilot icon to the right, below the three icons in the top right corner.  Yep, even Loop has a Copilot!  Click on the icon and have it suggest agenda items for your meeting!

To edit the formatting of your agenda, just right-click and you will see familiar editing options in the menu.

Loop Components allow for live co-editing, so you can collaborate on an agenda in real time with multiple other people once you’ve sent out the invite to the meeting (and added them as attendees), as meeting attendees automatically get the Loop Component shared with them (and only them – it’s still private).

 Do you want it so you can edit the meeting agenda later, but don’t want to let the attendees edit it?   You can change that setting by clicking on the title of the Loop Component, clicking “Recipients can edit” and changing “can edit” to “can view” (and then hit “Apply”):

Want to see all of your Loop Components in one place?  Click on the title of the Loop Component and click “Open in Web app”, scroll to the bottom of the component and click “View all components”, or you can go to loop.cloud.microsoft and click “Recent components and pages”.  Note that changes you make in the browser will sync across anywhere you have your Loop Component embedded:

This is far from the only application of Microsoft Loop – what other ideas are you now getting for what you could do with Loop?  Well, one thing you can do for sure with Microsoft Loop is create dynamic, collaborative meeting agendas that keep everyone on the same page. Give it a try and see how it can transform your meetings!
