Today’s blog is one that I’m very excited about - I'm going to show you all about how to use the brand new Copilot Prompt Gallery, or as they are calling it, “Prompts”, which is rolling out now.  It’s a place to store your favorite prompts and share prompts with your teams.

Two things to note:  One is that, as of right now, this does require an M365 Copilot license to use as an app in Teams.  You can still use the web version, however!  The other thing to note is that this may not be available for everyone yet, so be patient and know that it should be coming very soon!

One way to access the Prompt Gallery, also known as Prompts, is through adding it as an app in Teams.  

![Placeholder](/images/how_to_add_and_use_prompts_app1.png)

On the bottom left of your Teams app, click the three horizontal dots.  If you see the Prompts app already, go ahead and right-click on it and click "Pin".  If you don't see Prompts already listed, click the "Get more apps" button.  From there, search "Prompts" and "Add" the one that is published by the Microsoft Corporation.

Then, to get started using it, let's click on the Prompts button to open up the app and take a look.

You will notice there are three sections to the app - Microsoft Prompts, Your Prompts, and Team Prompts.

You'll notice there's probably nothing in Your Prompts and Team Prompts for you... yet, but I'll show you how to change that.

If you are looking for inspiration, you can sort, filter, and scroll through Microsoft's prompt gallery and save or share ones that you'd like to use again.  That's not our focus today, though.

Let's go to M365 Copilot chat and save a prompt of our own.  You can get here through Teams, through the web browser, or through the app on your computer - all three options will work.  For now, I'll use the Teams app.

You can do this in either Work or Web chat, wherever you'd normally put this prompt.  Enter in a prompt.  I'm going to enter in a simple prompt just to show you how to do it, but this is ideally for your most used, more specific prompts.

If you have dynamic content you want to include in your prompt, aka the stuff you get by hitting the backslash first in the Work chat, you will want to put in a placeholder unless you want to always refer to that file, meeting, or person.  See what I mean here:

See - where it says "insert meeting here", I'd normally actually refer to a specific meeting.  Because I don't want to save a specific meeting in my prompt, I've just put some text in as a placeholder instead.  Submit your prompt.

Now I don't get very good results - I didn't even give it a real meeting!  That's okay, because for once we aren't concerned with Copilot's response - we want to look at our prompt.  Hover over your prompt once Copilot is done generating its text and you will see some icons appear.  We want to click on the one that looks like a bookmark - "Save prompt".

Now, go back to Prompts and click the "Your prompts" tab.  You should now see your new prompt there!  So far, while you can access the prompt gallery from other Copilots, it appears that you can only save prompts from Copilot Chat.  However, I'd guess that soon you will be able to save prompts from other places as well - remember, this is brand new, so expect new features to be coming.

Now, notice that "Share" button on your prompt?  Let's try sharing that out to a team, which refers to a Microsoft 365 team.  All I have to do is click "Share to team", select my team from the drop-down list, and click Share!

Now, everyone in my team can view it in their prompt gallery, but let's look at an easier way to access team prompts.

Navigate to your team and the channel that you'd like your prompt gallery to live in, and click the plus sign at the top middle area.  Search for "Prompts", select it when it pops up, and click "Add".  Just like that, I now have a tab in Teams where all prompts shared with my team are there, easy to copy or just click "Try in Copilot Chat".

One other way to share prompts with people?  

Back in the Your Prompts section of the Prompts app, when you click the Share button, instead click "Copy link".  Note that anyone in your org with this link will now have access to this prompt unless you stop sharing it or delete it.  You can manage share access and stop sharing a link at any time by clicking on the gear in the top right-hand corner of "Your prompts".

And that's it!  I'm sure there will be all sorts of new features coming with this, but this is something a lot of people at my org have been asking for, and I'm so excited to announce that it's finally here!  Try it out today and let me know how it goes!  Thanks for your time, and happy prompting!
