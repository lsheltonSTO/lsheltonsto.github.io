Loop is a Microsoft product that has something called Components.

I&amp;rsquo;m actually in a new role as a Digital Workplace Advisor, focusing on M365 Adoption and Training efforts at a global company. It&amp;rsquo;s been very busy but exciting and a great new challenge, but not a lot to report out in blog form thus far. However, I still get the opportunity to help people with Power Automate solutions as they present themselves to me, and this one was an easy win that really wowed the end user without a lot of work on my end - major win there!</description></item><item><title>From Concept to Chatbot: ServiceNow with Copilot Studio - Part 4</title><link>https://blist.vercel.app/blog/202409from_concept_to_chatbot_servicenow_with_copilot_studio_part4/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2024 08:29:05 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://blist.vercel.app/blog/202409from_concept_to_chatbot_servicenow_with_copilot_studio_part4/</guid><description>Head back to the intro post to get the use case and architecture of the Copilot Studio bots I&amp;rsquo;ll be describing in these blog posts.

The Use Case A brief recap - I had 19 separate Power BI reports that, for various reasons, we decided to condense into one mega report using row-level security, or RLS. This gives each lab information about their storage - how much data are they storing, what does it cost, and a list of files that haven&amp;rsquo;t been updated in 3 years that might be prime targets for archiving.</description></item><item><title>Using Row-Level Security in Power BI and Power Automate</title><link>https://blist.vercel.app/blog/20240105using_row_level_security_in_power_bi_and_power_automate/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2024 11:29:05 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://blist.vercel.app/blog/20240105using_row_level_security_in_power_bi_and_power_automate/</guid><description>Power BI is not my normal wheelhouse, but when duty calls, I answer. I was recently asked to help update a report in Power BI that does all sorts of SQL calls to a database - how all of that works is a mystery to me. However, we were managing security by updating 19 different reports, one for each lab. This was a nightmare to maintain and update, as I discovered when my job was to go in and update all 19 of those reports.</description></item><item><title>The Power of Loop: A Surprising Twist in Task Syncing</title><link>https://blist.vercel.app/blog/202312the_power_of_loop_a_surprising-twist_in_task_syncing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Dec 2023 11:49:05 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://blist.vercel.app/blog/202312the_power_of_loop_a_surprising-twist_in_task_syncing/</guid><description>Spoiler alert: this blog post has a twist ending that you will NEVER see coming! Okay, maybe you will see it coming if you&amp;rsquo;d paid attention to some of Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s newer tools, but I&amp;rsquo;m getting ahead of myself.
The Use Case I had a user come to me asking for help building her first Power Automate flow, and what she wanted was pretty ambitious for a beginner. So, I jumped in and helped build out a POC based on her use case.</description></item><item><title>Automate Sending Out Feedback Using Power Automate Desktop</title><link>https://blist.vercel.app/blog/202310sending-out-feedback-using-power-automate-desktop/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Oct 2023 14:49:05 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://blist.vercel.app/blog/202310sending-out-feedback-using-power-automate-desktop/</guid><description>If you didn&amp;rsquo;t know, I spent the first 10 years of my career as a public middle school teacher.

She&amp;rsquo;s very self-reliant and had done her due dilligence at searching for an answer to her problem before admitting defeat and coming to me (and thus to Power Automate).

Because what happens when you try to make changes to that document library, oh so innocently, when yet another innocent person has - gasp - the file open? Then Power Automate and SharePoint both respectively freak out at you and nothing can get done until that document is cleared out.</description></item><item><title>How To: Block Downloads with Stream on SharePoint</title><link>https://blist.vercel.app/blog/202305how-to-block-downloads-with-stream-on-sharepoint/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 May 2023 14:49:05 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://blist.vercel.app/blog/202305how-to-block-downloads-with-stream-on-sharepoint/</guid><description>Anyone else stuck in a slow migration nightmare?
