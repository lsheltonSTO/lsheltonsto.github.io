I&amp;rsquo;m actually in a new role as a Digital Workplace Advisor, focusing on M365 Adoption and Training efforts at a global company. It&amp;rsquo;s been very busy but exciting and a great new challenge, but not a lot to report out in blog form thus far. However, I still get the opportunity to help people with Power Automate solutions as they present themselves to me, and this one was an easy win that really wowed the end user without a lot of work on my end - major win there!</description></item></channel></rss>
