Currently I work for a global legal services company, leading Microsoft 365 adoption and training efforts.
I spent the last decade teaching English Language Arts. During that time, I was selected to receive training to become a technology and pre-engineering teacher based on my aptitude for learning and adapting new technologies with my own students and colleagues.
I hold a BS in Secondary English Education from the University of Kansas and an MS in Curriculum and Instruction from Emporia State University.</description></item></channel></rss>
